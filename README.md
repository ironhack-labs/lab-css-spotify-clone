# LAB | CSS Spotify Clone

## Introduction

Everybody likes music, right? Odds are, if you do, you've heard of **Spotify**.

In this lab, we'll be building a simplified version of the Spotify landing page:

![Spotify image](https://i.imgur.com/xVD0bm6.jpg)

All of the necessary assets and images are included in the `starter-code`folder. You might also find it useful to resort to the [full length PDF version of the website](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ih-materials/uploads/spotify-prototype.pdf) as reference.

## Exercise

### Requirements

- Fork this repo
- Clone this repo

### Submission

Upon completion, run the following commands:
```
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "done"
$ git push origin master
```
Create Pull Request so your TAs can check up your work.


### Instructions

The starting files are included in the `starter-code` directory. Write your HTML and CSS in the `index.html` and `css/main.css` files respectively. Remember to follow the best practices.

### Steps

The page is split into 4 sections. 

#### Iteration 1: Navbar

- The navbar should be `position: fixed`.
- Align the logo to the left and the `ul` with the links to the right, either using `float` or `flex`.

#### Iteration 2: Large image background with text

- Check out [this guide](https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/) on centering things.

#### Iteration 3: What's on Spotify section

- It looks like the `div`s take up about a third of the container each. How can you represent this in code?

#### Iteration 4: The green section

- It looks like we have 2 main sections, a containing element with the text flowing from top to bottom, and the image of the Spotify player on the right.
- Position the Spotify logo absolutely according to the _green_ `div`.

Happy coding! ðŸ’™
