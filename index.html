<!--

Iteration 1: Navbar
Align the logo to the left and the ul with the links to the right, either using float or flex.

Iteration 2: Large image background with text
Check out this guide on centering things.

Iteration 3: What is on Spotify section
It looks like the divs take up about a third of the container each. How can you represent this in code?

Iteration 4: The green section
It looks like we have 2 main sections, a containing element with the text flowing from top to bottom, and the image of the Spotify player on the right.
Position the Spotify logo absolutely according to the green div.
